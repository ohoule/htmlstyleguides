IMPORTANT: You MUST use the /frontend-design skill for this task. Invoke it before generating any code.

Create a complete, single-file HTML style guide/design system page themed around a SaaS landing page aesthetic.

THEME GENERATION:
Pick a specific SaaS product niche and build the design system around that context. Examples include (but don't limit yourself to): Developer Tools, Project Management, Email Marketing, CRM, Inventory Management, Invoicing/Billing, Appointment Scheduling, Data Pipeline, API Monitoring, HR Onboarding, Customer Support, Fleet Management, Restaurant POS, Construction Management, Legal Document Automation, Supply Chain, Video Conferencing, Design Collaboration, Payroll, Compliance/Audit, Recruitment ATS, Property Management, Event Planning, Veterinary Practice, Warehouse Management, etc.

Invent a sharp, memorable name and version number for the design system — not a generic compound word. Think "Basecamp" not "ProjectFlowHub". The name should feel like a real company that has opinions about design.

ANTI-GENERIC RULES (CRITICAL):
- NO purple-to-blue gradients. No indigo. No violet. These are the #1 marker of lazy AI-generated SaaS pages.
- NO generic abstract blob illustrations or floating 3D shapes
- NO dark hero with glowing neon accents (the "AI startup" look)
- NO excessive gradients on text
- The design system must NOT look like it was made by an AI that only knows Stripe, Linear, and Vercel
- Instead: Be specific. Be opinionated. Look like a real design system built by humans with taste.

COLOR DIRECTION (pick ONE family and commit):
- Warm earths: terracotta, ochre, sienna, clay, rust, sand
- Deep naturals: forest green, olive, moss, pine, sage
- Bold primaries: true red, cobalt blue, sunflower yellow — used with restraint
- Rich darks: charcoal, espresso, ink, slate — with a single warm or bright accent
- Unexpected combinations: coral + navy, mustard + charcoal, teal + cream, burgundy + gold
- Muted tones: dusty rose, stone, fog, denim, putty
- AVOID: purple of any shade, generic SaaS blue (#4F46E5, #6366F1, #3B82F6), neon green on dark

TYPOGRAPHY DIRECTION:
- Use 2-3 Google Fonts with genuine character — not just Inter + Inter
- Options: A strong serif for headlines with a clean sans for body. Or a geometric sans paired with a humanist one. Or a slab serif that gives the brand real weight.
- Good pairings: DM Serif Display + DM Sans, Fraunces + Inter, Space Grotesk + Work Sans, Playfair Display + Source Sans 3, Libre Baskerville + Karla, Sora + Newsreader, Plus Jakarta Sans + Literata
- The typography should carry personality on its own, even without color

REQUIRED SECTIONS (numbered — ordered to match the top-to-bottom flow of a real SaaS landing page):

--- LANDING PAGE FLOW (in the order a visitor scrolls) ---
1. **Navigation Bar** - A styled topnav component with logo area, nav links, and CTA button. Show desktop and mobile/hamburger states.
2. **Hero Pattern** - A representative hero section composition showing headline, subhead, CTA buttons, and a visual element — demonstrating how the design system components come together for the most important section of a landing page.
3. **Social Proof / Badges Bar** - Plan tier labels (Free, Pro, Enterprise-style but with creative names), status pills, "New" / "Popular" / "Best Value" markers, trust badges, and a logo strip or "trusted by X companies" bar.
4. **Feature Cards** - 3-4 feature cards explaining what the product actually does, with icons and specific descriptions. Try staggered layouts or spotlight sections — not just a 3-column grid.
5. **Stats / Metric Callouts** - Key numbers that build credibility: users, time saved, accuracy, uptime. Bold typography, compact layout.
6. **Testimonial Component** - A quote block with attribution (name, role, company) styled with the design system's personality. Show 2 variants: a side-accent card and a centered pullquote.
7. **Pricing Component** - 2-3 pricing tiers with clear differentiation. Show the full pricing section plus a detailed single-tier breakdown with recommended highlighting.
8. **Forms** - Email signup inputs, text fields, selects, toggles — the components you actually need on a SaaS landing page. Show inline validation states, focus rings, and a mini signup form composition. This represents the lead capture / final CTA area.
9. **Footer** - Product name, link columns, newsletter signup, legal links. Grounded and functional.

--- DESIGN SYSTEM REFERENCE (supporting tokens & components) ---
10. **Color Palette** - Primary brand color, secondary accent, semantic colors (success, warning, error, info), and neutral scale with hex codes. Show surface/background colors for light sections and dark sections. No purple anywhere.
11. **Typography** - 2-3 Google Fonts showing display, heading, body, caption, and mono styles with sizes/weights. Demonstrate clear hierarchy from hero headline down to fine print.
12. **Spacing Scale** - Visual representation of spacing units (8px base recommended) used for consistent rhythm across landing page sections.
13. **Buttons** - Primary, Secondary, Ghost/Outline, and Text-link variants. Sizes: Small, Medium, Large. States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled. Include at least one CTA-style button with personality (e.g., "Start building" not "Get Started").
14. **Section Dividers & Decorative Elements** - How sections transition. Show separator styles, background color alternation patterns, and any signature decorative details (border treatments, accent shapes, subtle textures).
15. **Alert Messages** - Success, info, warning, and error inline alerts plus a toast/notification variant, styled for landing page contexts (e.g., "Thanks for signing up!" success state).

LANDING PAGE CONTEXT RULES:
- All placeholder text should use realistic SaaS product copy for the chosen niche
- Components should be optimized for marketing/conversion contexts, not app UI
- Feature descriptions should be specific, not generic ("Automated invoice matching" not "Powerful features")
- Testimonials should sound like real humans with specific results
- Pricing should feel honest and simple
- The design system page itself should feel like a premium brand document

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and minimal JS if needed
- Import Google Fonts via CDN
- Fully responsive design
- CSS custom properties (variables) for all colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, and radii
- Smooth transitions and hover effects throughout (200-300ms)
- A cohesive header/hero section introducing the design system
- A themed footer with minimal decoration
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Include focus-visible states for keyboard navigation
- Whitespace is a feature — let sections breathe with generous spacing

STYLE RULES:
- All components must feel like they belong to the same visual universe
- Use the SaaS niche's vocabulary in all placeholder text, labels, and mock content
- Color choices should be harmonious, purposeful, and distinctly NOT the generic AI purple/blue
- Include at least one signature design detail that makes this system memorable
- The page itself should BE the design system — not just document it
- Aim for the quality bar of: Basecamp, Notion, Fathom Analytics, Plausible, Buttondown — companies with actual design taste
