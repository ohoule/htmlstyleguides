First, read the frontend-design skill at /mnt/skills/public/frontend-design/SKILL.md before starting.

Create a complete, single-file HTML style guide/design system page with a PROFESSIONAL, ENTERPRISE-GRADE aesthetic.

THEME GENERATION:
Pick a professional industry or business context. The design should feel polished, trustworthy, and suitable for enterprise applications.

Invent a sophisticated, professional name for the design system that fits the industry (e.g., "Meridian", "Clarity", "Foundation", "Nexus", "Vertex").

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Clean, uncluttered layouts with generous whitespace
- Restrained color palettes (1-2 primary colors, neutral bases)

- Subtle, purposeful interactions (no flashy animations)
- High contrast for accessibility
- Consistent, predictable patterns
- Focus on usability over decoration

1. **Color Palette** - Professional primary color, secondary accent, semantic colors (success, warning, error, info), and neutral grays with WCAG-compliant contrast ratios

7. **Data Table** - Sortable columns, row hover states, pagination indicators, zebra striping or clean borders
8. **Badges/Status Indicators** - Filled and subtle variants for: Active/Success, Pending/Warning, Inactive/Error, Neutral/Info
9. **Design Principles** - 4-6 principles focused on: Clarity, Consistency, Accessibility, Efficiency, Trust, Scalability
10. **Micro-interactions** - Subtle hover states, focus rings, smooth transitions (200-300ms), loading states
11. **Professional Component** - Choose ONE: Data visualization placeholder, Breadcrumb navigation, Tabs, Pagination, or Modal dialog preview
12. **Notifications/Alerts** - Inline alerts and toast-style notifications for Success, Info, Warning, Error states with dismiss actions

COLOR GUIDANCE:
