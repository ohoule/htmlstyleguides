# HTML Style Guides

A creative project for generating themed, single-file HTML style guides with distinctive aesthetic themes.

## Overview

This project generates complete design systems as self-contained HTML files. Each style guide features a randomly selected aesthetic theme (Art Deco, Brutalist, Vaporwave, Nordic Minimalist, Steampunk, Botanical, Memphis Design, etc.) with cohesive visual elements throughout.

## Features

Each generated style guide includes 12 sections:

1. **Color Palette** - Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors with hex values
2. **Typography** - Headings, body text, and special display fonts
3. **Spacing Scale** - Consistent spacing system
4. **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, outline, and disabled variants
5. **Forms** - Inputs, selects, textareas, checkboxes, and radio buttons
6. **Cards** - Content containers with various layouts
7. **Data Table** - Styled tables with hover states
8. **Badges/Tags** - Status indicators and labels
9. **Design Principles** - Guidelines for using the design system
10. **Animation Effects** - Hover transitions and micro-interactions
11. **Terminal/Special Component** - Theme-specific unique element
12. **Alert Messages** - Success, warning, error, and info states
